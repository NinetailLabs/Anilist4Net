# Anilist4Net
Hell yeah! An Anilist API for .NET that doesn't suck!

## Reason for creation
I needed an API to get user IDs for [Anime Preview](https://github.com/cainy-a/AnimePreview), but current API libraries kinda suck.
### Miki.Anilist
Okay, but doesn't support users. Also has no documentation and a dead Discord server.
### Anisharp
I couldn't figure out how to use this, let alone get anything back other than an exception. Also, no documentation.

## Aim
Create a nice API for Anilist with documentation, and good ease of use
